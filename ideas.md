  **Design Movement**: "Wolf of Wall Street" meets "Cyberpunk Terminal"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **High-Stakes Intensity**: The design should feel like a high-frequency trading terminal or a mission control center. Dark, sleek, and data-driven.
  2. **Gamified Progress**: Visualizing sales progress as "unlocking" levels or hitting revenue targets.
  3. **Focus & Clarity**: Information density is high, but hierarchy is strict. Critical scripts and objection handlers must be instantly accessible.
  4. **Aggressive Motivation**: Use bold, imperative language and visuals that evoke success, wealth, and dominance.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Deep, void black (#050505) and dark gunmetal grey (#121212).
  - **Primary Accent**: "Electric Gold" (#FFD700) for success, money, and key actions.
  - **Secondary Accent**: "Terminal Green" (#00FF41) for positive reinforcement and "Signal Red" (#FF3333) for alerts/objections.
  - **Intent**: Evoke the feeling of a high-end financial terminal where money is made. Gold signifies the $25k+ deal target.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Dashboard-First**: The home page is a command center, not a landing page.
  - **Split-Screen Training**: Scripts on one side, objection handlers/notes on the other for real-time call support.
  - **Collapsible Modules**: "Accordions" and "Drawers" to keep the interface clean until information is needed.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: Critical tools (Objection Map, Script) are always one click away.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **"The Deal Ticker"**: A scrolling ticker tape effect showing "Recent Wins" or motivational quotes.
  - **"Heatmap" Visuals**: Abstract data visualizations as background textures.
  - **Monospace Typography**: For data points and "code-like" elements, mixed with a strong sans-serif for headlines.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Response**: Hover states should be snappy and immediate.
  - **"Tactile" Buttons**: Buttons should feel like physical switches or keys being pressed.
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power users (sales reps) should be able to navigate via keyboard (e.g., 'O' for Objections).

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements "slide and snap" into place like mechanical parts.
  - **Feedback**: subtle "glitch" or "flash" effects on successful actions.
  - **Progress Bars**: Smooth, accelerating fills.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: *Space Grotesk* (Bold, Uppercase) - Technical but aggressive.
  - **Body**: *Inter* (Clean, legible) - For long-form reading (playbook).
  - **Data/Code**: *JetBrains Mono* - For scripts and metrics.

  **Design Movement**: "Modern Stoic Luxury"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Clarity of Thought**: A minimalist, distraction-free environment that promotes focus and deep learning.
  2. **Premium Materiality**: The interface should feel like a high-end magazine or a luxury car dashboard.
  3. **Structured Knowledge**: Information is presented in well-defined, digestible "cards" or "blocks."
  4. **Quiet Confidence**: No shouting. The value is self-evident.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: "Paper White" (#F5F5F7) or "Warm Sand" (#EAE5E1).
  - **Typography**: "Charcoal" (#333333) and "Deep Navy" (#1A2B3C).
  - **Accent**: "Burnished Copper" (#B87333) or "Slate Blue" (#5A7D9A).
  - **Intent**: To create a sense of calm authority and professional excellence.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based Grid**: Content is organized into elegant, shadowed cards.
  - **Asymmetric Typography**: Large, expressive headlines paired with structured body text.
  - **Generous Margins**: ample whitespace to let the content breathe.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Serif Headings**: Using a modern serif font for a touch of elegance.
  - **Fine Lines**: 1px borders and dividers to create structure.
  - **Subtle Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows to create depth.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Transitions**: Elements fade in and out gently.
  - **Deliberate Hover**: Hover effects are subtle shifts in color or elevation.

  **Animation**:
  - **Parallax Scrolling**: Background elements move slower than foreground.
  - **Fade-Ins**: Content gently fades in as you scroll.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: *Playfair Display* (Serif) - Elegant and authoritative.
  - **Body**: *Lato* or *Proxima Nova* (Sans-serif) - Clean and modern.

  **Design Movement**: "Neon Noir / Synthwave Sales"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **High Energy**: The design should pump up the sales team. It's a game, and we're winning.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid-Breaking**: Elements overlap and break out of standard containers.
  - **Diagonal Lines**: To suggest movement and dynamism.
  - **Floating Elements**: UI components float above the background.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Gradients**: Everywhere. Text, buttons, backgrounds.
  - **Glow Effects**: Neon glows around active elements.
  - **Retro Icons**: Pixel art or synthwave-style iconography.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Bouncy**: Animations have a bit of bounce and elasticity.
  - **Flashy**: Hover effects trigger glows or color shifts.

  **Animation**:
  - **Neon Flicker**: Text or borders occasionally flicker like neon signs.
  - **Slide-Ins**: Elements slide in from the sides with a trail.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: *Montserrat* (Black/ExtraBold) or a retro display font.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* (Clean) to balance the loud headers.
